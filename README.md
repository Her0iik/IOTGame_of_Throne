# ðŸš½ Game of Trone : Paper is coming ðŸ§»

This entire project has been made during quarantin, each member of the group was at home and distant from each other.
We couldn't access to the appropriate materials to do the physical project, so we use different software to carry out the project, like TinkerCad.
Also everything is schematic so we don't have picture off the final product.
## Project and goals

In these dark times, toilet paper becomes a valuable resources for surviving your quarantine.

This is why we created a brand new tool, the inteligent and connected toilet paper dispenser : enter your stock in the app and decide the require quantity for each commission and the dispenser will give only what you need, nothing more ! 

The Game of Throne dispenser will also detect the end of the roller and send you a notification so you can add it on your shopping list. 

Each person of the house can define via the application the number of sheet for the small or big comission. You can launch the comission on the toilet you're using and the dispenser will give you the correct amount of sheets.

If you have some thieves in your house and someone is trying to get your precious paper or use more sheets than needed by trying to open the paperbox, an alarm will ring in your house so you can get the thief.

The Game of thrones is presented as a case which can contain the toilet paper roll :

There is also another case you can place in the living room, this case is only for the alarm.

## How it works 

To use this dispenser you gonna need first to go on the app create an account and create or join a house. If your creating one, you can add other member to the house when created.

After that you need to set the number of sheets of toilet paper you gonna need for each commission :

When everything is in place you can start what you're here for, the comission.
First you need to select on the app which comission you're up to : the big or the small.

Once the comission is selected, the LCD screen on the housing will give to you the number of toilet paper sheets remaining for your comission.

When you've finished your business, you can now ask for sheets. To do that you need to tap on the app for each sheets you use. The dispenser will give it to you and the lcd screen will decrement at each sheets of paper.

Once everything is done you can click on the finish button. If you've use less toilet paper than required, you've earned Pandemic points.
