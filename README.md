# 🚽 Game of Trone : Paper is coming 🧻

## Project and goals

In these dark times, toilet paper becomes a valuable resources for surviving your quarantine.

This is why we created a brand new tool, the inteligent and connected toilet paper dispenser : enter your stock in the app and decide the require quantity for each commission and the dispenser will give only what you need, nothing more ! 

The Game of Throne dispenser will also detect the end of the roller and send you a notification so you can add it on your shopping list. 

Each person of the house can define via the application the number of sheet for the small or big comission. You can launch the comission on the toilet you're using and the dispenser will give you the correct amount of sheets.

If you have some thieves in your house and someone is trying to get your precious paper or use more sheets than needed by trying to open the paperbox, an alarm will ring in your house so you can get the thief.
